## Become a DLang GSocC Contributor

### Get in Touch

Throughout GSoC you'll use either our [forums](https://forum.dlang.org/) or [Discord server]() - TODO invite link for communication.
Use the Discord server to introduce yourself and ask any questions about the DLang environment.
The community is always happy to help newcomers.

Start with the [Contributor guide](https://wiki.dlang.org/Starting_as_a_Contributor).
Then make some small contributions.
Filter through the GitHub issues using the labels to find entry-level improvements you can bring to either:

1. [The DMD reference compiler](https://github.com/dlang/dmd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3ASeverity%3Adocumentation%2CSeverity%3Aminor%2CSeverity%3ARefactoring%2CSeverity%3Atrivial%2C%22Severity%3ABug%20Fix%22%20)

1. [The Phobos standard library](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3ASeverity%3Adocumentation%2CSeverity%3Aminor%2C%22Severity%3ABug%20Fix%22%2CReview%3ATrivial)

We cannot stress this enough: ask the community for guidance whenever you feel stuck or lost.

### Choose Your Project

Each year we put together a list of potential projects.
For 2025, the start of the list can be found [here](http://dlang.github.io/gsoc/gsoc-2025/project-ideas.html).
You can come up with new project ideas either by making a post on the `#projects` channel on our Discord server or by reaching out to our mentors directly.
